           <p>Introductory content - for example name, logo, navigational aids, author information</p>
           <p>Headers are only associated with the nearest sectioning element—typically a &lt;body&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, 
              or &lt;article&gt; element. This means that multiple &lt;header&gt; elements can be used to add introductory
              content to different parts of a document.</p>
           <section class='header-inlay'>  
            <nav class='nav-box'>
                <p class='nav-inlay' id='nav-text1'>
                    The &lt;nav&gt; element lets you mark up the various navigation sections of your website. 
                    This goes for the main site navigation, links to related pages in a sidebar, tables of content,
                    and pretty much any group of links. For example, we should stick our site-wide navigation menu 
                    in a &lt;nav&gt; element.
                </p>
                <h2 class='nav-inlay'>&lt;nav&gt;</h2>
                <p class='nav-inlay' id='nav-text2'>
                    This is a great piece of semantic information for search engines. It helps them quickly identify 
                    the structure of your entire website, making it easier to discover other pages. It`s possible to 
                    include multiple &lt;nav&gt; elements on a single page with different sets of related links.
                </p>
            </nav>
           </section> 
        </header>
        <article class='article'>
            <h1>&lt;article&gt;</h1>
            <p>The &lt;article&gt; element represents an independent article in a web page. It should only wrap content 
               that can be plucked out of your page and distributed in a completely different context. For instance, 
               an app like Flipboard should be able to grab an &lt;article&gt; element from your site, display it in its 
               own app, and have it make perfect sense to its readers.</p>
            <section class='article-inlay'>
                <h2>&lt;section&gt;</h2>
                <p>The &lt;section&gt; element is sort of like an &lt;article&gt;, except it doesn`t need to make sense outside the 
                   context of the document. That is, an app like Flipboard wouldn`t try to pull out all the &lt;section&gt;`s 
                   of a page and present them as independent pieces of content.</p>
                <p>Each &lt;section&gt; element should contain at least one heading, otherwise it will add an “untitled section” to your 
                   document outline.</p>
            </section>
            <aside class='article-inlay'>
                <h1>&lt;aside&gt;</h1>
                <p>Headers and footers are ways to add extra information to an article, but sometimes we want to remove information 
                   from an article. For example, a sponsored blog post might contain an advertisement about the sponsoring 
                   company; however, we probably don`t want to make it part of the article text. 
                   This is what the &lt;aside&gt; element is for.</p>
            </aside>
        </article>
        <article class='article'>
            <h1>&lt;article&gt;</h1>
            <header class='article-inlay'>
                <h2>&lt;header&gt;</h2> 
                <p>For instance, the title, author, and publication date of &lt;article&gt; is pretty good for another &lt;header&gt;.</p> 
            </header>
            <p>Things like blog posts, newspaper articles, or web pages dedicated to a single topic, there`s often 
               only one &lt;article&gt; element on the page. But, it`s perfectly legal to have more than one &lt;article&gt; 
               element per page. A good example is a page that displays a bunch of blog posts. Each one of them can be 
               wrapped in a separate set of &lt;article&gt; tags (you don`t need to add this to our article.html page).</p>
            <footer class='article-inlay'>
               <h1>&lt;footer&gt;</h1>
               <p>Footers behave the same as &lt;header&gt; in that they`re associated with the nearest sectioning element. So, we can 
                  use it for our page`s copyright notice and the author information inside our &lt;article&gt;.</p>   
        </article>
        <aside class='aside'>
            <h1>&lt;aside&gt;</h1>
            <p>When used outside an &lt;article&gt;, an &lt;aside&gt; is associated with the page as a whole (much like &lt;header&gt; and 
                &lt;footer&gt;). This makes it a good choice for marking up a site-wide sidebar.</p>
        </aside>
        <footer class='footer'>
            <h1>&lt;footer&gt;</h1>
            <p>Conceptually, footers are basically the same as headers, except they generally come at end of an 
               article/website opposed to the beginning. Common use cases include things like copyright notices, 
               footer navigation, and author bios at the end of blog posts.</p>
            <nav class='footer-inlay'>
                <h2>&lt;nav&gt;</h2>
            </nav>
